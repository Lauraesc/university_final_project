# University Management System

This project is the final exercise for the Java Basics module. The goal was to build a system to keep track of university classes, professors, and students in a simple but functional way.

Each professor has a name and a salary calculated differently depending on their type: full-time professors get their base salary plus 110% for each year of experience, while part-time professors get their base salary multiplied by their active hours per week. Each student has a name, a unique ID, and an age.

University classes have a name, an assigned classroom, a professor, and a list of students. The system starts with several professors of both types, a handful of students, and some pre-created classes to test the functionality. From the interactive menu, you can view all professors, explore classes and their details, create new students and assign them to classes, create new classes with existing professors and students, and even search all classes a student is enrolled in using their ID.

From a technical perspective, the project applies object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Constructors are used to properly initialize objects, static attributes and methods are included where needed, and the code is organized into clear packages separating data models, service logic, and the main class. User interaction happens through the console, keeping input/output separate from the data models. The project also includes a UML diagram showing the overall system design.

The code is version-controlled with Git, using multiple branches and commits to show the projectâ€™s evolution, and a proper `.gitignore` is included to keep generated files from IDEs or the operating system out of the repository.

In short, this project is a functional system for managing a small university, putting Java basics and object-oriented programming best practices into practice.
